  ## Description
  This application allows the user to create a readme.md doc through the node.js command line. 
  
  ## Installation
  The intention is to make this available via an npm, but for now one may simply grab the code from GitHub.
  
  ## Usage
  Any/All developers should provide a readme doc in each of their public GitHub repos. This node application allows the dev to create readme docs in a templated fashion, through the command line. Much of the core markdown text needed in a good readme doc is automatically applied to the final result, from which a dev may alter or customize further.
